# School-Data-Science-Projects
This repository is a collection of finished data science projects I completed while in school. The README file will have a synopsis for each project. All projects were completed in R,including, an R script, an R markdown, and HTML file. Only the HTML file needs to be downloaded/opened to view the results of the project. Please keep in mind that the R scripts are preliminary results and the R markdown file is the final version. This means that only the R markdown needs to be viewed.

This project includes machine learning models, the results of those models, and a synopsis of how effective each model was. The data used for this is the same as the first project.

### Project 3 (Machine Learning Effectiveness)
[to project](https://github.com/Thornberry19/School-Data-Science-Projects/tree/project_3 "Project 3")

This project is a full encompasing data science project, including exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, and final thoughts and cojectures. Done in a group of two, a friend of mine worked on the exploratory data analysis, while I worked on building the machine learning models and testing their effectiveness. We both collaborated closely to make sure we were on the same page about both our roles.
