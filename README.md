# School-Data-Science-Projects
This repository is a collection of finished data science projects I completed while in school. The README file will have a synopsis for each project. All projects were completed in R and have both an R script file and an R markdown file. Please keep in mind that the R scripts are preliminary results and the R markdown file is the final version. This means that only the R markdown needs to be viewed.
